        Grime-encrusted bathrooms with mouse droppings in the corners. Floors so filthy, your shoes would stick to them. A resident who hadn’t had a bath in more than two months.
      </p>

      <p>
        That’s what inspectors from the New York Department of Health found when they visited New Roc Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, a 120-bed nursing home in Rochester, New York. With 85 health violations reported by the Center for Medicare and
        Medicaid Services, New Roc has the third-highest number of such citations in all of New York state’s nursing homes.
      </p>

      <p>
        New Roc is also, like many of the nation’s 15,600 nursing homes, seriously understaffed. According to the Long-Term Care Community Coalition, each nursing home resident needs at least 4.1 hours of active care per day to be well taken care
        of. In reality, the average nursing home resident gets less than three and a half hours of direct care each day. For a healthy adult, that’s just over half an hour’s difference; but for a nursing home resident, it can mean the difference
        between quality care and dangerous neglect.
      </p>

      <p>
        Using data collected by the Center of Medicare and Medicaid Services, the NYCity News Service was able to quantify this difference. By comparing CMS’s ratings for quality of care between understaffed and well-staffed nursing homes, we can
        better understand the consequences of understaffing; and by looking at the demographics of nursing homes with different staffing levels, we can begin to identify some iniquities in nursing home staffing across race and class lines.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our analysis found that, on average, nursing homes with top-rated staffing also have better health ratings than nursing homes with CMS’s lowest staffing score. The best-staffed nursing homes also have, on average, just over half as many
        violations as the worst-staffed.
        Interestingly, CMS’s “quality measures” rating, which takes into account things like how many residents develop bedsores and how many are placed on antipsychotic medication, was almost exactly the same between the best- and worst-staffed
        homes.

        These relationships aren’t surprising to Yue Li, a professor of public health at the University of Rochester Medical Center. In fact, his team has found such a strong connection between staffing and quality that they use staffing numbers,
        rather than CMS’s quality data, to measure nursing home quality in their own research.
      </p>

      <p>
        “There is strong evidence that higher staffing level is leading to better quality,” he said, adding that the number of Registered Nurses on staff is also closely linked to patients’ health and well-being.
      </p>

      <p>
        Asked why CMS’s own quality rating was so consistently high even among the worst-staffed nursing homes, Li said that that score may be distorted by patient characteristics like age, gender, and baseline health status, and that his team has
        found that CMS doesn’t make enough statistical adjustments to fix these factors’ outsize influence.
      </p>

      <p>
        Robyn Grant, the director of public policy and advocacy at the National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care, isn’t surprised, either. She says that at places like nursing homes, which serve residents who may need help with dressing,
        eating, bathing, and using the bathroom, understaffing can be downright dangerous.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Without enough staff, people can’t get enough nutrition, they become dehydrated, they aren’t taken to the bathroom, they get out of bed and they fall,” she said. “There are so many ramifications.”
      </p>

      <p>
        It doesn’t end there, Grant added. Without enough staff, residents who spend most of their time in bed develop dangerous sores from not being moved often enough. Residents who are incontinent go hours without being changed or cleaned.
        Residents become depressed from the lack of social interaction. And nonverbal residents with dementia, who may become agitated or cry out to signal that they’re in distress, are indiscriminately placed on heavy-duty antipsychotic drugs with
        serious side effects to silence their outbursts.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Families find their mother slumped in a wheelchair, drooling, and totally unresponsive,” Grant said. “They can’t participate in life, let alone in activities that bring them joy or even interact with their family members. They’re out of
        it.”
      </p>

      <p>
        While, according to the Long-Term Care Community Coalition, the vast majority of nursing homes deal with understaffing, Li and others say that nursing homes serving lower-income residents and residents of color may be disproportionately
        affected.
      </p>

      <p>
        In fact, the NYCity News Service’s analysis showed that, on average, more than 87% of residents at the best staffed nursing homes are white, compared to less than 60% of residents at the worst staffed nursing homes. In other words: on
        average, well-staffed nursing homes are whiter than understaffed nursing homes.

      </p>

      <p>
        “Minorities and lower income folks often getting care in facilities that tend to be the worst facilities,” said Grant. “There are some real disparities there.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Li says low Medicaid payments may be to blame for the staffing and quality disparities across socioeconomic status: without sufficient payments from Medicaid, nursing homes that serve residents on Medicaid don’t have enough money to hire the
        staff they need.
      </p>

      <p>
        Toby Edelman, a senior policy attorney at the Center for Medicare Advocacy, traces staffing problems back to the Nursing Home Reform Act, which was passed in 1987. Edelman explained that while the law mandated that nursing homes needed to
        have a Registered Nurse on staff during the day shift, it didn’t set any staffing standards or minimum staff-to-resident ratios. And in New York, there isn’t any state law that sets minimum staffing requirements, either.
      </p>

      <p>
        The result, Grant says, is that for-profit nursing homes see staff as an easy target for budget cuts.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You cut the staff because you can,” she said. “You cut it to the bone, and then what we end up seeing is terrible, terrible understaffing.”

        “It’s cruel and it’s inhumane,” she added. “When you can’t provide the care to that extreme, I think it’s a form of abuse. Certainly neglect.”
